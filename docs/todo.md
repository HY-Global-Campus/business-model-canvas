# Wigets

Widgets are saved to the database as a json blob, so the database will now know anything about their form.Widgets will be their own components. You can find that data a widget should have [here](readme.md#Widget)
If all that seems confusing, you can start with just making the visuals and we can hook the actual data later. Feel free to add things if you thinks that something more is neccessary.

Widgets that have some user input should have a answer json associated with them.
At this point, we have planned only TextBoxExercise which has answers.
The answer object for this can look just like

```
{
    answer: string,
}
```

This will then be put into a answer object (and to the database) like this:

```
Answer {
    id: <answer_id, autogenerated for db>
    course_id: <id of the course this belongs to>
    user_id: <id of the user whose answer this is>
    widget_type: widgetType.TextBoxExercise (widgetType would be an enum)
    widget_id: <id of the specific instance of the widget in db>,
    answer_blob: {
        "answer": "Some user inputted text",
    } 
}
```

For now atleast, let's not save chatbot discussions in DB.

# Page

Page should have a left part and a right part. (On mobile they are in a column).
One part has one widget. There will be a variable amount of pages per course and we
need to render them with url parameters like /courses/course_slug/pages/page_id or /courses/course_slug/pages/page_slug. We also need to fetch all the page ids/slugs to a list that is used for the left/right navigation with buttons or arrow keys. 

# Miscallaneous
    * Remove maindmap things
    * This includes zustand related things

# OAuth support (client)

Not a priority. Either make this with OAuth standard and mock moocfi,
or just figure something else if testing with users is needed. Or ignore for now.
    * Change the login system to use mooc OAuth (which is not implemented yet)
    * Current uses simpler login at Accelbyte.
